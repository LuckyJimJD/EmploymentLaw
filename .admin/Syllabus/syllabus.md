# Description

This course surveys federal and state laws governing employment. Topics to be covered include establishing an employment relationship; recruitment & hiring; supervisory control and employee autonomy; confidentiality & competition; wages & hours; workplace safety & health; termination of employment; and arbitration of employment disputes. Some of the issues touched on in this course are covered in further depth in other courses, such as Employment Discrimination and Labor Law. 

After completing the course, you should be able to recognize and diagnose legal issues arising in the employment context, analyze those issues under the applicable law, and help clients avoid those issues or remedy them when they arise. Simulation problems provide an opportunity to develop practical skills for representing clients in employment matters. 

# Policies 

##### Grading

In-class performance and the final exam will each count for 50% of your final grade. 

The in-class performance component of your final grade depends on your preparation before class (completing all assigned reading and reviewing simulation problems),[^1] regular and prompt class attendance, and constructive engagement during class. 

[^1]: Elon Law School's standards and ABA guidance for awarding course credit assume at least two hours of out-of-class student work for each hour of classroom instruction.

The final exam will be a take-home research and writing assignment that will involve both doctrinal and policy analysis. The exam will be distributed on the last day of class (July 18) and is due on the last day of the exam period (July 23). 

##### Attendance 

Elon Law School has adopted the following attendance policy for all courses: 

> The Law School administers a policy that a student maintain regular and punctual class attendance in all courses in which the student is registered, including externships, clinical courses, or simulation courses. Faculty members will give students written notice of their attendance policies before or during the first week of class. These policies may include, but are not limited to: treating late arrivals, early departures, and/or lack of preparation as absences; imposing grade or point reductions for absences, including assigning a failing grade or involuntarily withdrawing a student from the class; and any other policies that a professor deems appropriate to create a rigorous and professional classroom environment.
>
> In case of illness or emergency, students may contact the Office of Student and Professional Life, which will then notify the student’s instructors. A student may notify the faculty member directly of a planned absence and should refer to individual faculty members regarding any policy that may apply. In the case of prolonged illness or incapacity, the student should contact the Office of Student and Professional Life.

Excessive absences (more than 2 classes) may result in a reduction of your grade.

##### Honor Code 

The Law School honor code applies to all activities related to your law school study, including conduct during class and examinations.
